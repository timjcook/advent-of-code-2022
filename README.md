# Advent of Code - 2022

We're writing some ruby (again). I'll document some things. Can't wait

## Day 1 - Calorie counting
Nice to be back into it. Nice warm up exercise. I brought across a number of utility functions that I used in previous years. Found that adding an Elf abstraction that could return the "total_calories" held by that elf was really useful because I could use it to sort, sum, map etc.
